# The Youth Review

This is a personal project created by the 17-year-old me. It uses Ruby on Rails, jQuery, and the Froala WYSIWYG editor. I'm most proud of the Medium.com-like autosaving functionality. Some other functionalities include:
- User accounts and authorization
- Image upload to AWS S3
- HTML sanitization and extraction
 
Below are some screenshots of the app:
